    <!-- Operational History -->
    <section class="bnl-section">
        <h3>Service Record</h3>
        <p>
            Before ASPEN ever pinned a badge to her coat, Thea cut her teeth in overworked city clinics and disaster-relief
            wards, learning the hard way how quickly a quiet shift can turn into a full-scale emergency. Recruited for her
            rare blend of bedside softness and battlefield focus, she was eventually promoted to Chief Medical Officer for
            the ASPEN Medical Division.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recognizable at a distance by her speckled fur, bright medical vest, and ever-present field tablet, Dr. Thea
            has become a reassuring constant across ASPEN installations. When alarms sound, she’s already moving —
            rerouting med-teams, opening overflow bays, and setting up triage points before most systems finish their first
            warning chime.
        </p>
        <p>
            Off-duty, she’s known for checking in on crew who “insist they’re fine,” organizing quiet decompression corners
            in crowded stations, and sketching little anatomical doodles on whiteboards to explain complex conditions in
            plain language. Whether she’s stabilizing a downed operative in a smoky corridor or reminding a rookie to drink
            water and actually sleep, Dr. Thea embodies ASPEN’s core directive:
            <em>“Because your health matters — especially when everything else is on fire.”</em>
